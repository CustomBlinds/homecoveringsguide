      <h2>Quick answers for George homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best shutters for coastal air</strong>: PVC indoor shutters in living rooms, kitchens and bathrooms handle George’s humidity far better than wood.</li>
        <li><strong>Best for security</strong>: Aluminium security shutters offer physical barrier protection with built in locks and fixed top and bottom rails.</li>
        <li><strong>Light and privacy control</strong>: Adjustable louvres allow you to tilt light in, keep neighbours’ sightlines out and still allow airflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical use areas</strong>: Stacking doors, street facing windows, bedrooms, bathrooms and braai rooms that open to the garden.</li>
        <li><strong>Who installs in George</strong>: Local specialists in the Garden Route, including <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/george/" rel="noopener">Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings™ George</a>, measure and install shutters on site.</li>

      <h2>Why shutters work well in George</h2>
      <p>George has a mix of damp winters, coastal air and strong sun. Curtains can hold moisture and dust, while basic blinds sometimes rattle in the wind. Shutters give you a solid, fitted solution that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces fading on floors and furniture by blocking direct UV.</li>
        <li>Allows controlled airflow without flapping fabric.</li>
        <li>Can be wiped down easily, which helps with coastal salt and pollen.</li>
        <li>Adds a permanent, built in look that suits many George estates and golf estate developments.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>PVC indoor shutters</h2>
      <p>PVC shutters are designed for interior use and are especially popular in kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.</p>
      <h3>Where PVC shutters are a good fit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bathrooms and ensuites where there is steam and moisture.</li>
        <li>Kitchens where blinds would sit close to hobs or prep areas.</li>
        <li>Bedrooms on the south or west side that need darkening and privacy.</li>
        <li>Street facing windows where you want neat, clean lines from outside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Compared with many blinds, PVC shutters feel more permanent and often help resale value, since they stay with the home.</p>

      <h2>Security shutters for George properties</h2>
      <p>Security shutters combine the look of plantation shutters with the strength of security barriers. In George, they are commonly used on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stacking doors that open onto patios and braai areas.</li>
        <li>Ground floor bedroom doors that open into the garden.</li>
        <li>Kitchen doors and side passages that need extra protection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Security shutters usually include reinforced side channels, internal locking mechanisms and top and bottom tracks that make it difficult to lift or lever them out. Homeowners often choose them instead of separate security gates to keep the look consistent.</p>

      <h2>Shutters compared with other options</h2>
      <p>Shutters sit in the same family as blinds and security products. If you are still deciding, it helps to compare:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Versus blinds</strong>: blinds are usually more cost effective and easier to swap out, while shutters are more permanent and add structure. See the in depth comparison in <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/insights/shutters-vs-blinds-perfect-window-coverings/" rel="noopener">this shutters vs blinds guide</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Versus security bars</strong>: traditional burglar bars still work well, but security shutters give a more streamlined, integrated finish and still allow you to open them during the day. For comparison, look at <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safety-bars/" rel="noopener">modern safety bar options</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Measuring, installation and maintenance</h2>
      <p>With shutters, accurate measuring matters more than with many fabric coverings. Frames are custom made for each opening, so installers in George will normally:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Measure every width and height in at least three places for inside or face mount frames.</li>
        <li>Check squareness of the reveal and note tiles, skirtings and bulkheads.</li>
        <li>Discuss how doors and windows open so the shutter panels do not clash with handles.</li>
        <li>Confirm colour, number of panels and which side panels should stack toward.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Maintenance is generally simple: a soft cloth and mild soapy water for PVC, and manufacturer approved cleaners for aluminium security shutters.</p>
