  <h1>Awnings in Sedgefield</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Awnings turn Sedgefield patios and decks into reliable outdoor rooms. The right system gives shade and light rain cover,
    while still keeping the feel of an open braai or breakfast space.

  </section>

  <h2>How awnings perform in Sedgefield conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Sedgefield has a mix of still days and sudden wind that channels along the coast.
    A good awning design will account for that, so it feels safe to use and simple to live with.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of awnings that fit Sedgefield homes</h2>
  <h3>Retractable folding arm awnings</h3>
  <p>
    Folding arm awnings are popular on family homes and holiday houses that want flexibility.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Extend for lunch, retract when wind picks up or when you want winter sun.</li>
    <li>No posts, which keeps decks open for furniture and movement.</li>
    <li>Needs careful specification and operation in very exposed locations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Fixed wedge and louvred awnings</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed awnings provide constant cover without relying on daily operation.
    They work well over main doors and smaller patios that are used daily.
  </p>

  <div class="tip">
    Many Sedgefield owners choose a fixed awning over the main entrance, then consider a retractable or louvred option over larger decks that face the view.
  </div>

  <h2>Span, projection and drainage</h2>
  <p>
    When planning an awning:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure the full width of the area, including any pillars or downpipes.</li>
    <li>Decide how far the awning must project to cover furniture and circulation.</li>
    <li>Ask how water will drain off the fabric or slats and where it will land.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Pairing awnings with outdoor blinds and shutters</h2>
  <p>
    Many Sedgefield decks work best when you combine:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A roof or <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/awnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awning</a> overhead.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor blinds</a>
      on exposed sides for wind and rain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutters</a>
      inside for light, privacy and security.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions Sedgefield owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Will an awning darken my living room?</h3>
  <p>
    A fixed awning can reduce light slightly on small openings.
    Folding arm systems keep flexibility, and light coloured fabrics help keep interiors bright.
    Shutters and light blinds inside also help you balance shade and daylight.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I use one awning for both braai and parking?</h3>
  <p>
    It is usually better to separate entertaining and parking if possible.
    Awnings over braai areas can be specified for people comfort,
    while shade ports can be designed specifically for vehicles.
  </p>

  <p class="footer-note">
    Always confirm wind ratings, fabric warranties and maintenance requirements for your awning,
    especially in a coastal town like Sedgefield.
