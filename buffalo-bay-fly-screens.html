  <h1>Fly Screens in Buffalo Bay</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Buffalo Bay evenings are made for open doors, braais and the sound of the waves.
    Fly screens let you enjoy that airflow while keeping insects from the lagoon and dunes out of bedrooms and living rooms.
  </p>

      <li><strong>Who</strong> Look for brands and installers experienced with coastal mesh and hardware.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why fly screens matter in a coastal village</h2>
  <p>
    Standing water, vegetation and warm evenings attract insects around Buffalo Bay.
    Holiday homes and full-time residences both benefit from screens so that windows can stay open
    without worrying about mosquitoes and other pests.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of fly screens that suit Buffalo Bay</h2>
  <h3>Hinged and sliding screen doors</h3>
  <p>
    These are common on main doors and stackers that lead to your deck or braai area.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hinged doors for single swing doors.</li>
    <li>Sliding panels for patio doors and stackers.</li>
    <li>Good choice for everyday access in and out from the sand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retractable window screens</h3>
  <p>
    Retractable screens suit upper bedroom windows and spaces where you do not want a permanent frame
    in the view. The mesh pulls away into a cassette when not needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Mesh choices for wind, sand and pets</h2>
  <p>
    The right mesh balances visibility, airflow and durability:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard insect mesh for general use where pets do not push against the screen.</li>
    <li>Stronger or pet-resistant mesh where dogs and children lean on doors.</li>
    <li>Darker meshes for better outward visibility during the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tip">
    Ask your supplier how the mesh will handle salt and UV and what cleaning routine they recommend for Buffalo Bay conditions.
  </div>

  <h2>Layering fly screens with shutters and outdoor blinds</h2>
  <p>
    Screens work best as part of a small system that manages airflow, light and security:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Combine fly screens with <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutters</a>
      for bedrooms where you want both airflow and light control.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use screens on doors behind <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor blinds</a>
      so you can open doors without inviting insects when blinds are partially down.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety latch</a> on selected windows
      to keep them securely ajar at night while screens handle insects.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Buffalo Bay questions about fly screens</h2>
  <h3>Can I keep my existing timber doors and just add screens?</h3>
  <p>
    In many cases yes. A supplier can add hinged or sliding screen doors in front of existing doors, provided
    there is enough space and the structure is sound. Photos and simple measurements will help them confirm this.
  </p>

  <h3>Will screens block my sea view?</h3>
  <p>
    Darker, fine mesh usually disappears more than light-coloured mesh. During the day you will see the bay clearly
    while the mesh softens only the brightest glare.
