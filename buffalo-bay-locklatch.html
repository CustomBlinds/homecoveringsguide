    windows and some doors safely ajar for breeze while managing security, pets and children.
  </p>

    <h2>Quick answers for Buffalo Bay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> Adjustable steel latches that hold windows or doors partly open while still locked.</li>
      <li><strong>Who</strong> Choose a supplier that understands both the product and how it fits into your security plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> Bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and smaller access doors that need safe night ventilation.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> Usually more affordable than full security gates or shutters, with cost driven by quantity and door type.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why safety latches suit Buffalo Bay homes</h2>
  <p>
    Apart from safety and security, latches support comfort:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Night ventilation while you sleep with the sound of the sea.</li>
    <li>Airflow in children’s rooms without the risk of large openings.</li>
    <li>Fresh air in bathrooms and kitchens when you are away from home.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How latches integrate with shutters, screens and blinds</h2>
  <p>
    A latch is a small part of a broader system:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use latches on windows behind <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutters</a>
      so you can angle blades for privacy while the opening stays restricted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine latches with <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/fly-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly screens</a>
      to stop insects while the gap remains fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
      On doors, pair latches with <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/security-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security screens</a>
      or gates to keep the main leaf locked while a smaller section provides airflow.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who supplies LockLatch and similar products in the Garden Route</h2>
  <p>
    Home Coverings Guide does not sell or fit safety latches. For Buffalo Bay and the wider Garden Route,
    many homeowners use LockLatch and related products supplied through local window and security specialists.
  </p>

    One example is the <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety latch and LockLatch information from Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings™</a>,
    which explains different latch options for child safety, pet access and secure ventilation.

  <h2>Buffalo Bay questions about safety latches</h2>
  <h3>Can latches fit on existing aluminium and timber windows?</h3>
  <p>
    In most cases yes. Installers can attach latches to aluminium or timber frames, as long as there is enough space
    and the frame is sound. Share photos so they can confirm before you commit.
  </p>

  <h3>Are latches enough on their own for security?</h3>
  <p>
    A latch helps restrict opening size and acts as a deterrent, especially higher up where access is limited.
    For ground floor or easily reached windows you may still combine latches with
    <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/security-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security screens</a> or shutters.
  </p>

  <p class="footer-note">
    Always ask your chosen supplier how safety latches fit into your broader security strategy,
    and confirm installation details and warranties in writing.
