    <h1>Awnings in George – Shade You Actually Use</h1>
    <p>
      George has bright days, sideways rain and afternoon wind that often ruins a braai or family lunch outside.
      The right awning can turn a bare patio into an extra living room that works in more than one season.

    <section aria-label="Quick answers">
      <h2>Quick answers before you choose an awning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best spots</strong> – north or west facing patios, braai areas, sliding doors and exposed kitchen doors.</li>
        <li><strong>Popular types</strong> – fixed louvre awnings for permanent cover and retractable fabric awnings for flexible shade.</li>
        <li><strong>Key climate factor</strong> – wind. George’s gusts mean brackets, beams and fabric must be specified properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Rough expectations</strong> – a good awning should survive years of sun, rain and wind without sagging or peeling if maintained.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fixed aluminium louvre awnings</h2>
      <p>
        Fixed aluminium louvre awnings are sturdy and low maintenance. They are ideal where you want permanent shelter with light control.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent for braai patios that need year round protection from rain and UV.</li>
        <li>Blades can be set at an angle that lets light in during winter and blocks high summer sun.</li>
        <li>Aluminium suits coastal conditions and handles George’s passing showers well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Retractable fabric and folding arm awnings</h2>
      <p>
        Retractable awnings and folding arm systems give you shade when you need it and open sky when you don’t.
        They suit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Patios that feel dark in winter and need sun on mild days.</li>
        <li>Cafés and restaurants that want flexible outdoor seating.</li>
        <li>Balconies and townhouses where you cannot add heavy permanent structures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Look for strong arms, quality acrylic fabric and proper fixing into brick or concrete. Markiso, Dickson and similar fabrics are good examples of proven outdoor textiles.

      <h2>Patio layout tips for George weather</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Combine awnings with outdoor blinds on the wind side to create a “room” effect.</li>
        <li>Make sure rainwater can drain off correctly, especially on large spans.</li>
        <li>Think about braai smoke paths so fumes do not trap under low awnings.</li>
        <li>Add lighting and power points while the structure is going up to avoid messy retrofits later.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintenance checklist</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rinse aluminium and hardware with fresh water a few times a year to clear salt and dust.</li>
        <li>Let fabric awnings dry fully before retracting after heavy rain.</li>
        <li>Schedule a quick hardware check before storm season to tighten fixings and lubricate moving parts.</li>
