  <h2>Why Outdoor Blinds Work So Well in George</h2>
  <p>George has a unique climate pattern: warm seasons, scattered rainfall, and sudden gusts moving off the Outeniqua Mountains. Outdoor blinds help manage those quick weather shifts, especially on patios, decks and braai areas. They keep furniture dry, block cross-winds and extend outdoor living time throughout the year.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Types of Outdoor Blinds for George Homes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear PVC Blinds:</strong> Great for rain protection and visibility. Best for sheltered patios.</li>
    <li><strong>Woven Mesh Blinds:</strong> Handles wind better than PVC and reduces harsh sunlight while keeping airflow.</li>
    <li><strong>Canvas Drop Blinds:</strong> High privacy and high shade. Good for west-facing exposures.</li>
    <li><strong>Motorised / Crank Options:</strong> Helpful for larger decks and caravans where manual systems are inconvenient.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Local Weather Considerations</h2>
  <p>Because George can switch from warm to windy within minutes, choose hardware that resists side-movement and fabrics that won’t stretch under damp conditions. Mesh fabrics generally perform best for exposed patios, while PVC works well in sheltered entertainment areas.</p>

  <h2>Installation Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask for stainless steel fittings wherever possible to avoid rust.</li>
    <li>Measure the wind-side of your patio first; tension here matters most.</li>
    <li>Consider adding side-channels if your area is heavily exposed.</li>
    <li>Mesh blinds look neater on modern homes, while PVC suits enclosed braai rooms.</li>
  </ul>
