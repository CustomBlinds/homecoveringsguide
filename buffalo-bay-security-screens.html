  <h1>Security Screens in Buffalo Bay</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Security screens give Buffalo Bay homes a neat alternative to heavy burglar bars. You keep the view,
    enjoy the breeze and still have a barrier on sliding doors and windows that face paths, dunes and parking areas.
  </p>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why Buffalo Bay homes look at security screens</h2>
  <p>
    Many Buffalo Bay properties are used as holiday homes or short-term rentals. Owners often want:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enough security to feel comfortable leaving the house closed up between visits.</li>
    <li>Good airflow in summer without moving heavy burglar gates.</li>
    <li>A cleaner coastal look than traditional bars on big glass doors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How security screens differ from burglar bars</h2>
  <p>
    Security screens combine a strong stainless or high-grade mesh with an aluminium frame and quality locks.
    From a distance they read as dark glass rather than a grid of bars.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow constant airflow on hot nights while doors and windows are locked.</li>
    <li>Maintain views over the bay and dunes in the day, especially with darker mesh.</li>
    <li>Integrate with existing doors and windows without a separate gate track in many cases.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pairing screens with shutters, blinds and latches</h2>
  <p>
    Security screens are only one layer. Your full solution may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security shutters</a>
      on key openings where a solid barrier is needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor blinds</a>
      to handle wind and rain on decks while screens manage security.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safety latches such as LockLatch</a>
      on smaller windows where a full security screen is not necessary.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who supplies security screens along the Garden Route</h2>
  <p>
    Home Coverings Guide does not sell or install screens. For Buffalo Bay, it is common to work with Garden Route companies
    that specialise in insect and security screens and that partner with national screen brands.
  </p>
  <p>
    One example is the <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/security-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security screen range from Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings™</a>,
    supported by a broader <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screens and insect solutions overview</a>.
    Their <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insights blog</a> also covers rust-resistant, baboon-aware screen choices.
    To explore options for Buffalo Bay openings you can use the
    <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact page</a> for advice.

  <h2>Questions Buffalo Bay owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Will security screens cope with wind on exposed decks?</h3>
  <p>
    Properly installed screens are designed to sit firmly in their frames, but exposure still matters.
    Openings that take direct wind may need additional consideration or a different solution such as
    <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security shutters</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Can screens be fitted to my existing aluminium doors?</h3>
  <p>
    Most systems can be fitted in front of or behind existing doors, depending on space. An installer will look
    at clearances, drainage and how often doors are used before recommending a layout.
  </p>

  <p class="footer-note">
    Always ask for written confirmation of security ratings, corrosion guarantees and lock warranties
    from your chosen security screen supplier.
