    <h1>LockLatch &amp; Safety Latches in Knysna</h1>
    <p>
      Knysna homes need fresh air, security and protection from baboons, monkeys and curious pets. 
      Safety latches such as LockLatch allow you to keep windows and doors partially open while still locked, 
      so bedrooms, kitchens and living spaces stay cool without feeling exposed.
    </p>

      <li><strong>Security level:</strong> Acts as a strong physical restraint and visible deterrent, especially paired with safety bars or screens.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why safety latches suit Knysna and the Garden Route</h2>
    <p>
      The Garden Route climate encourages open windows. At the same time, many Knysna homes face opportunistic break-ins, wildlife, 
      and the risk of children or pets pushing through open doors. Traditional burglar bars and gates solve some problems but can 
      look heavy and still leave rooms hot and airless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety latches bridge that gap. They set a fixed maximum opening for your window or door so you can enjoy airflow 
      without inviting people, animals or bad weather inside.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Night ventilation without leaving windows completely open</li>
      <li>Extra layer of security when paired with safety bars or security screens</li>
      <li>Helps prevent wind damage on casement and French doors</li>
      <li>Ideal for coastal humidity and warm summer evenings in Knysna</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Where LockLatch works best in a Knysna home</h2>
    <p>
      Common applications in Garden Route properties include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Upstairs bedrooms</strong> where opening windows fully at night feels unsafe</li>
      <li><strong>Children’s rooms</strong> where fall risk or wandering is a concern</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen and scullery windows</strong> that need airflow but face pathways or parking areas</li>
      <li><strong>Patio and French doors</strong> that you want slightly open without blowing wide in the wind</li>
      <li><strong>Holiday homes and Airbnbs</strong> where guests may not always lock up correctly</li>
      <li><strong>Baboon-sensitive areas</strong> such as Pezula, Knysna Heights and forest-edge properties</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of safety latches you will see</h2>
    <p>
      Different latch formats suit different openings and lifestyles. A typical range looks like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LockLatch®</strong> &ndash; general-purpose latch for doors and windows, ideal for night ventilation and extra security.</li>
      <li><strong>MiniLatch®</strong> &ndash; compact version for smaller windows or where you want only a narrow opening.</li>
      <li><strong>PetLatch®</strong> &ndash; for families that want controlled pet access without a permanent pet door.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In most Knysna homes, a mix of these latches is used: standard LockLatch for bedrooms and living spaces, MiniLatch for 
      bathroom and side windows, and PetLatch for doors or windows used by cats and small dogs.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>How installation usually works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Assessment</strong> &ndash; the installer checks frame material (aluminium, timber, steel or uPVC), window type and opening sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Placement</strong> &ndash; ideal fixing points are chosen so the latch is strong, practical and discreet.</li>
      <li><strong>Fitting</strong> &ndash; stainless-steel components are drilled and fixed to frame and sash, and the opening length is set.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing</strong> &ndash; windows and doors are opened, locked and pulled against the latch to confirm security and smooth operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Care tips</strong> &ndash; you are shown how to adjust the opening length and keep the latch clean in coastal conditions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For most standard windows, installation is quick and can be combined with other work such as safety bars, security screens 
      or new blinds.

    <h2>Pairing latches with safety bars, screens and blinds</h2>
    <p>
      Safety latches work best as part of a layered approach. In Knysna, that often means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Safety bars</strong> on key windows for discreet strength</li>
      <li><strong>Insect or security screens</strong> where bugs or wildlife are a problem</li>
      <li><strong>Blinds or shutters</strong> to manage light and privacy once the opening is set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are planning a new build or renovation, it is worth designing all three together so windows look clean and handle 
      security, airflow and privacy without clutter.

    <h2>Frequently asked questions about safety latches in Knysna</h2>

    <h3>Will a safety latch stop baboons and monkeys?</h3>
    <p>
      It is designed to restrict the opening to a controlled gap and uses strong stainless-steel components. 
      When combined with sensible window placement and, where needed, safety bars or screens, it significantly reduces 
      the chance of baboons or monkeys pushing their way inside.
    </p>

    <h3>Can children still open the window further?</h3>
    <p>
      The latch creates a fixed maximum opening. Children can usually operate the normal window handle, but they cannot 
      widen the gap beyond what you and your installer set, which reduces fall risk from upper-storey windows.
    </p>

    <h3>Does it work with aluminium and uPVC frames?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. LockLatch-style latches are designed to fit aluminium, timber, steel and uPVC frames. The installer will use 
      appropriate fasteners for each material so the fitting remains secure in coastal conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>What maintenance is needed in a coastal climate?</h3>
    <p>
      Basic care is enough: occasional rinsing with fresh water to remove salt, a mild detergent if needed, and checking 
      screws once or twice a year. Stainless-steel components are selected specifically for Garden Route environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I add these to a home that already has blinds or shutters?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Safety latches can be retrofitted to most existing windows and doors. In many homes, they are added alongside 
      existing blinds, shutters and safety bars to upgrade security without changing the whole window treatment.
