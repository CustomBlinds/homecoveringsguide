  <h1>Fly Screens in Wilderness</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Wilderness is built for open windows and doors. Fly screens let you enjoy the river and sea breeze
    without inviting insects from the lagoon, wetlands and gardens into your bedrooms and living spaces.
  </p>

  <section class="aeo-summary">
    <h2>Quick answers for Wilderness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> Mesh screens on doors and windows that block insects while allowing airflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Who</strong> Use a supplier familiar with coastal mesh, powder coated frames and Garden Route wind.</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> Lagoon side homes, hilltop houses, guest houses and apartments near the N2 or village.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> Varies by opening type, frame system and mesh grade rather than one flat rate per square metre.</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong> Decide which rooms need bug control first, measure or photograph openings and then compare hinged, sliding and retractable options.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why fly screens matter in Wilderness</h2>
  <p>
    Between the river mouth, lakes and gardens, Wilderness has plenty of standing water and plant life.
    That means insects in summer evenings and after rain. Fly screens help you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleep with windows open without worrying about mosquitoes.</li>
    <li>Cook and entertain with patio doors open while lights are on.</li>
    <li>Vent bathrooms and kitchens naturally rather than relying only on extraction fans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of fly screens that suit Wilderness homes</h2>
  <h3>Hinged and sliding screen doors</h3>
  <p>
    These work well on main entrances and sliding doors from living rooms onto decks, courtyards and balconies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hinged screens on single swing doors that open to the garden or driveway.</li>
    <li>Sliding screens for patio doors that look towards the sea or across the river valley.</li>
    <li>Ideal where children and pets move in and out all day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retractable window and door screens</h3>
  <p>
    Retractable screens pull across or down when needed and disappear into a cassette when not in use.
    They suit view windows and minimal interiors where you do not want a permanent frame in sight.
  </p>

  <h2>Mesh choices for view, airflow and pets</h2>
  <p>
    The right mesh is a balance between visibility and durability:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard insect mesh where windows are opened often but pets do not push against the screen.</li>
    <li>Stronger, pet resistant mesh for sliding doors that dogs or cats lean on.</li>
    <li>Darker mesh where you want the best outward visibility towards the lagoon, village or ocean.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tip">
    In high humidity areas near the river and wetlands, ask for mesh that copes with mildew and how often it should be cleaned.
  </div>

  <h2>Layering fly screens with shutters, blinds and latches</h2>
  <p>
    Screens are one part of a bigger Wilderness comfort setup. You can combine them with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutters</a>
      in bedrooms where you want airflow plus light and privacy control.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor blinds</a>
      on decks that take wind and rain from the sea side.
    </li>
    <li>
      Safety latches such as <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LockLatch</a>
      to hold windows partially open while screens keep insects out.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions Wilderness owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Will fly screens spoil my view of the lagoon or sea?</h3>
  <p>
    Light frames and darker mesh usually disappear into the background, especially in daylight.
    At night, you may notice the mesh more with interior lights on, but the trade off is far fewer insects.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I fit screens to existing aluminium windows and doors?</h3>
  <p>
    In many cases yes. A screen supplier will look at frame depth, opening direction and handles to decide between hinged, sliding or retractable designs.
    Clear photos and rough measurements are enough for an initial recommendation.
