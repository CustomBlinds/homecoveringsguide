  <h2>Shutter materials that work in Sedgefield</h2>
  <p>
    With sea air and humidity, most Sedgefield homes focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="pill">PVC interior shutters</span> for wet rooms, bedrooms and living spaces.</li>
    <li><span class="pill">Aluminium security shutters</span> for doors and high risk openings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    PVC shutters offer a clean, classic look and are easy to wipe down.
    Aluminium shutters give a stronger barrier while still letting light and breeze through.
  </p>

  <h2>Where shutters make sense in a Sedgefield layout</h2>
  <h3>Bedrooms and guest suites</h3>
  <p>
    Shutters let you sleep in and manage street or neighbour light, while allowing airflow on warm nights.
    They are useful on both lagoon side and village side homes.
  </p>

  <h3>Doors to decks and patios</h3>
  <p>
    On stack doors or French doors, security shutters add peace of mind when you are away or sleeping,
    especially in houses that are unoccupied during parts of the year.
  </p>

  <h2>Layering shutters with screens and outdoor blinds</h2>
  <p>
    Shutters rarely work alone. For best results in Sedgefield, think in layers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Shutters plus <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/fly-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly screens</a>
      where insects are a concern near the lagoon or gardens.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shutters plus <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor blinds</a>
      on decks that need wind and rain protection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shutters plus a <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety latch</a>
      for controlled night ventilation in bedrooms.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions Sedgefield owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Do shutters work on bay windows and angled openings?</h3>
  <p>
    Many suppliers can handle bay windows and some special shapes, but they need more careful measurement.
    Share photos and measurements early so they can confirm what is practical before you commit.
  </p>

  <h3>Can shutters replace burglar bars?</h3>
  <p>
    Aluminium security shutters can replace bars on many windows and doors.
    For some large openings or very high risk areas you may still combine shutters with
    <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/security-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security screens</a>
    or other measures as part of a full security plan.
