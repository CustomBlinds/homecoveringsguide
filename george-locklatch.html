      <h2>What LockLatch style safety latches do</h2>
      <p>
        A LockLatch style device is a compact stainless steel latch that fixes between the frame and sash of a window or door. 
        It creates a lockable gap so you can leave openings ajar without leaving them vulnerable. 
        The gap is adjustable, which means you can set it small for security or slightly wider for airflow and pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, this turns a fully open window or door into a controlled opening: air and light still move, 
        but the opening cannot be pushed wider without unlocking the latch.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why LockLatch works so well in George</h2>
      <p>
        George has warm summers, coastal humidity and pockets of wildlife activity. Many homes run warm in the evenings 
        and rely on open windows for relief. At the same time, residents worry about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leaving windows or balcony doors open at night.</li>
        <li>Baboons and monkeys in certain suburbs and greenbelt areas.</li>
        <li>Cats and dogs slipping out through open doors and windows.</li>
        <li>Holiday guests leaving openings too wide when they visit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A correctly installed safety latch lets you crack windows and doors without giving up control. 
        Bedrooms, home offices and coastal living areas can breathe while staying more secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Homes and spaces in George that benefit most</h2>
      <p>
        Almost any home can use LockLatch, but it is especially useful for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upstairs bedrooms that need cool air but must stay secure at night.</li>
        <li>Living rooms and braai areas with sliding doors that are often left ajar.</li>
        <li>Homes near greenbelts or golf estates where baboons patrol.</li>
        <li>Holiday homes and Airbnbs that stand empty between guests.</li>
        <li>Families with pets that lean or push against doors and windows.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pairing LockLatch with screens and shutters</h2>
      <p>
        LockLatch is most effective when it forms part of a layered security plan. In George and the Garden Route, homeowners often combine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Security screens and fly screens</strong> to stop insects and create a physical barrier 
          while keeping views open.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indoor shutters</strong> to add privacy, light control and extra security behind glass.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outdoor blinds</strong> on patios to shelter living spaces from wind and weather while 
          LockLatch keeps doors safely ajar behind them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A latch alone is a strong start. Combined with screens and shutters it becomes a very calm way to live with open windows and doors.
      </p>

      <h2>Choosing the right openings for a safety latch</h2>
      <p>
        When planning LockLatch in a George home, walk through your spaces and note where you most often:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leave windows tilted or partly open for air.</li>
        <li>Worry about children climbing near openings.</li>
        <li>See pets pushing or scratching at sliding doors.</li>
        <li>Smell coastal humidity building up when everything is closed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These become your priority latch points. A professional installer will then check frame types, 
        clearances and hardware to make sure the latch fits cleanly and works with your existing locks.
      </p>

      <p>

        baboon zones and how latches integrate with blinds and screens. Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings supplies 
        and installs safety lock latches, insect screens and security screens throughout George and the wider region.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions about LockLatch in George</h2>
      <h3>Will LockLatch work on my aluminium windows and sliding doors?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases yes. The system is designed to fit common aluminium and timber frames. 
        A site check will confirm exactly where it can be installed and how wide the safe opening can be.
      </p>

      <h3>Can a safety latch help with baboons and monkeys?</h3>
      <p>
        A properly installed latch limits how far a window or door can open. This makes it significantly harder for baboons 
        and other wildlife to push openings wide enough to enter, especially when combined with strong screens.
      </p>

      <h3>Is LockLatch useful for holiday homes in George?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Owners can leave selected openings set to a safe, lockable gap so the house breathes between stays. 
        Guests also benefit from secure night ventilation while they sleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Does LockLatch replace burglar bars or security screens?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Think of it as a complement rather than a replacement. LockLatch controls the opening, 
        while security screens or shutters add an additional protective layer where needed.
      </p>
