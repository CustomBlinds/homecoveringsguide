      <h2>Why outdoor blinds work so well in Mossel Bay</h2>
      <p>
        Mossel Bay’s climate is one of the mildest on the Garden Route – warm, mostly dry and with more than 300 days of sunshine a year. That also means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Afternoon wind across patios and decks.</li>
        <li>Glare off the ocean or bay, especially on west and north-west facing spaces.</li>
        <li>Occasional misty rain and cooler evenings when you still want to sit outside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Outdoor blinds create a controllable “screen” around your living areas so you can cut wind and glare without fully enclosing the space like a sunroom.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of outdoor blinds to consider</h2>

      <h3>Clear PVC blinds for weather protection</h3>
      <p>
        Clear PVC blinds act like a temporary glass wall. They are popular along the Garden Route because they:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block wind and sideways rain on exposed decks and braai areas.</li>
        <li>Keep views towards Diaz Beach, Hartenbos or the bay.</li>
        <li>Help trap warmth on cooler winter evenings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Screen fabric blinds for glare and privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Mesh or screen blinds are better where sun and privacy are the main problem. Choose these when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You want daytime privacy from neighbouring townhouses or complexes.</li>
        <li>Glare bounces off paving or the pool into lounges and dining areas.</li>
        <li>You still want airflow during hot summer days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Side-channel vs guide-wire systems</h3>
      <p>
        On windier Mossel Bay sites, side-channel systems keep fabric stable and reduce rattling. Guide-wire systems are neater for light to moderate wind and sea-facing balconies where space is tight.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Choosing outdoor blinds for your Mossel Bay property</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Stand where you sit most often and note the direction of wind and sun. This tells you whether you should prioritise clear PVC (weather) or mesh (glare and privacy).
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sea-facing homes:</strong> Focus on wind stability, corrosion-resistant hardware and side-channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Golf estate or inland suburbs:</strong> Glare and privacy are usually bigger issues than driving rain.</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday rentals:</strong> Choose robust systems that are simple for guests to operate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outdoor blinds FAQ for Mossel Bay homeowners</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will outdoor blinds survive the Mossel Bay wind?</h3>
        <p>
          Correctly specified blinds with side-channels, proper fixing into brick or concrete and marine-grade hardware cope well with typical coastal winds. Extremely exposed sites may need extra bracing or a different solution such as louvre awnings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do clear PVC blinds go yellow in the sun?</h3>
        <p>
          Lower-grade PVC can yellow or become brittle if not cared for. Ask your installer about UV-stable marine-grade PVC, cleaning instructions and expected lifespan in full coastal exposure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I motorise outdoor blinds?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Motorisation is helpful on wide spans or upstairs balconies. Garden Route specialists often pair outdoor blinds with Somfy motors and wind sensors so blinds retract automatically in strong gusts.
