          <h2>What outdoor blinds need to handle in Plettenberg Bay</h2>
          <p>
            Plett decks and braai areas sit in a mix of strong summer sun, cross-winds and salty moisture. Good outdoor blinds need to cut wind without feeling like plastic walls, control glare off the water and survive coastal conditions without rusting or yellowing.
          </p>
          <h3>Key jobs for outdoor blinds in Plett</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Calm the wind on decks without closing the space completely</li>
            <li>Reduce glare from sea and pool reflections</li>
            <li>Protect furniture and flooring from UV and rain</li>
            <li>Handle salt air and coastal corrosion over time</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Clear PVC vs mesh blinds</h2>
          <p>
            Most homes in Plettenberg Bay choose between clear PVC “window” panels and woven mesh blinds. Both work, but they feel different in real life.
          </p>
          <h3>Clear PVC drops</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Best when you want a wind barrier and a view</li>
            <li>Keeps out drizzle and sideways rain on stormy days</li>
            <li>Needs gentle cleaning to avoid scratching and clouding</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Mesh outdoor blinds</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Breathes better on humid evenings</li>
            <li>Softens wind and glare instead of sealing the area</li>
            <li>Good for privacy from neighbours above or next door</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many Garden Route homes combine the two: PVC on the most exposed sides and mesh on the others. A local installer can help you balance airflow and protection around your specific deck or balcony.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Side-track, cable or simple roll-down</h2>
          <p>
            The way an outdoor blind is guided matters as much as the fabric. In windy Plett weather, stable guidance stops blinds from rattling and wearing out quickly.
          </p>
          <h3>Side-track systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fabric runs in side channels, so it stays tight and quiet</li>
            <li>Best for very windy decks and view balconies</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cable-guided systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses stainless cables to keep blinds aligned</li>
            <li>Good in moderate wind and for flexible layouts</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Simple roll-downs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Entry-level option with straps or clips at the bottom</li>
            <li>More movement in wind, but suits sheltered patios</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>FAQ: Outdoor blinds in Plettenberg Bay</h2>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Do outdoor blinds block the sea view?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              Clear PVC panels keep the view while cutting wind. Mesh blinds soften the view slightly but work better for glare and privacy. You can mix both types around a deck.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Will outdoor blinds rust near the ocean?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              Good suppliers specify stainless steel and powder-coated fittings for coastal homes. Ask directly what grade hardware and brackets will be used on your installation.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How do I clean outdoor blinds?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              Rinse off salt and dust with fresh water and use a soft cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive sponges, especially on clear PVC panels.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Can I close in my whole patio with blinds?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              Yes, but it is usually better to keep at least one opening or door panel for fast ventilation. A local installer can help you plan exits and airflow.
