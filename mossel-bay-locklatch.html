      <h1>LockLatch Style Solutions in Mossel Bay</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Lockable window and door latches allow you to keep openings partly open for air while preventing them from being opened fully from the outside. In coastal towns like Mossel Bay this is useful for both security and ventilation.

      <h2>Quick guide to lockable latches</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cases:</strong> Night time ventilation, pet access, leaving windows on latch when you are at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Doors:</strong> Often used on sliding doors and stable doors.</li>
        <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Used to limit how far a window can open while still allowing airflow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Mossel Bay homeowners fit LockLatch type devices</h2>
      <p>Typical installations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bedroom windows that you want to leave slightly open at night.</li>
        <li>Kitchen or scullery windows that need ventilation without being wide open.</li>
        <li>Sliding doors where pets need a gap to move in and out, but you still want a locked setting.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Benefits in a coastal environment</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        Mossel Bay's mild climate encourages people to leave doors and windows open. Lockable latches help you enjoy airflow while maintaining security.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Enjoy airflow while limiting how far openings can be forced.</li>
        <li>Control access for pets without leaving a full opening.</li>
        <li>Reduce the feeling of being closed in behind solid barriers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Working with other security measures</h2>
      <p>
        LockLatch type solutions are usually used together with other security products such as shutters, security screens or safety bars. They are not a replacement for full security barriers but an extra layer for comfort and convenience.

      <h2>LockLatch FAQ for Mossel Bay</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can LockLatch devices replace full security measures?</h3>
        <p>
          No – they are an extra layer of convenience and security for times when you want partial ventilation. They should be used alongside proper security systems, not as a replacement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will lockable latches work with my existing windows?</h3>
        <p>
          Most sliding and hinged windows can accommodate some type of lockable latch. A site visit will confirm compatibility with your specific window frames and opening mechanisms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are lockable latches safe for children?</h3>
        <p>
          When properly set, they prevent windows from opening wide enough for a child to fall through while still allowing ventilation. However, they should not replace adult supervision or proper child safety measures.
        </p>
