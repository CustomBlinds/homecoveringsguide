  <h1>Fly Screens in George</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    George homes sit between the Outeniqua mountains and the coast, which means mild weather, gardens and plenty of insects.
    Fly screens help you open your windows and doors to fresh air without sharing your living spaces with mosquitoes and bugs.
  </p>

  <section class="aeo-summary">
    <h2>Quick answers for George</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> Mesh screens fitted to doors and windows that block insects while allowing airflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Who</strong> Use a supplier familiar with coastal conditions, corrosion and different mesh grades.</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> Bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and braai areas in suburbs and estates across George.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> Varies by system type, opening size and mesh, not one flat price per square metre.</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong> Decide which rooms need bug control first, measure or photograph openings and compare hinged, sliding and retractable options.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why George homes benefit from fly screens</h2>
  <p>
    Between irrigated gardens, greenbelts and nearby coastal areas, insects are part of everyday life in George.
    Screens make it easier to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleep with windows open on warm nights in suburbs like Heather Park, Glen Barrie or Kingswood.</li>
    <li>Cook and entertain with patio doors open in areas such as Denneoord and Blanco.</li>
    <li>Vent bathrooms and sculleries without leaving large, unprotected openings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fly screen systems that suit George houses and apartments</h2>
  <h3>Hinged and sliding screen doors</h3>
  <p>
    Hinged and sliding screens work well on main entrances and patio doors to decks, courtyards and braai spaces.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hinged screens for single swing doors and kitchen doors to side yards.</li>
    <li>Sliding screens for patio doors and stackers that open to gardens or views.</li>
    <li>Robust frames and pet resistant mesh where dogs and children use the doors often.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retractable window and door screens</h3>
  <p>
    Retractable screens pull across or down when needed and roll away into a cassette when not in use.
    They are popular in George for view windows and more minimal interiors where you want the window to look bare when closed.
  </p>

  <h2>Choosing mesh for airflow, view and pets</h2>
  <p>
    The right mesh is a trade off between clarity and toughness:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard insect mesh for bedrooms and living rooms where screens are not pushed or kicked.</li>
    <li>Stronger pet mesh on doors near gardens where dogs lean or jump.</li>
    <li>Darker mesh for better outward visibility towards gardens, fairways or mountain views.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tip">
    For coastal facing properties and holiday homes in the broader George area, ask how to clean mesh and frames so they last in salt air and dust.
  </div>

  <h2>Working with shutters, outdoor blinds and safety latches</h2>
  <p>
    Fly screens are one part of a simple comfort and security system. In George they often sit alongside:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutters</a> in bedrooms and lounges for privacy and light control while windows stay open.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor blinds</a> on covered patios and braai rooms for wind and rain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safety latches</a> on selected windows for secure night ventilation in family rooms and guest suites.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where to use fly screens in a George layout</h2>
  <p>
    Common priority areas include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Main bedroom and childrens rooms that open to gardens, courtyards or balconies.</li>
    <li>Kitchens with doors to side yards, herb gardens or service areas.</li>
    <li>Living rooms with stacking doors to covered patios or stoep areas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions George owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Will fly screens change the look of my aluminium windows and doors?</h3>
  <p>
    Modern screen systems are designed to sit neatly against existing aluminium or timber frames.
    Dark mesh usually reads as a light tint from inside, especially during the day,
    and slim frames help keep the overall look clean.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I retrofit screens to existing homes and estates?</h3>
  <p>
    In most cases yes. Suppliers design hinged, sliding or retractable systems around existing frames and openings.
    Clear photos and simple measurements are enough for an initial quote and layout suggestion, whether you are in a free standing home or an estate.
