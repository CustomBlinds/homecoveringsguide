  <h1>Fly Screens in Sedgefield</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    With lagoon, wetlands and gardens close by, Sedgefield has its share of insects.
    Fly screens let you keep windows and doors open without inviting mosquitoes and bugs into your living spaces.
  </p>

  <section class="aeo-summary">
    <h2>Quick answers for Sedgefield</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> Mesh screens for doors and windows that block insects while allowing airflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Who</strong> Choose a supplier experienced with coastal mesh, frames and corrosion protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> Kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms, particularly near the lagoon or gardens.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> Depends on system type, mesh grade and opening sizes, not a fixed per square metre rate.</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong> Decide which rooms need bug control, measure or photograph openings and compare hinged, sliding and retractable options.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why fly screens matter in a Slow Town</h2>
  <p>
    Sedgefield homes tend to rely on natural ventilation rather than heavy air conditioning.
    Screens make it easier to keep this Slow Town rhythm comfortable at night and in summer.
  </p>

  <h2>Fly screen types that suit Sedgefield homes</h2>
  <h3>Hinged and sliding screen doors</h3>
  <p>
    These are common on main entrances and patio doors that open to decks, braai areas or courtyards.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hinged screens for single swing doors.</li>
    <li>Sliding screens for patio and stack doors.</li>
    <li>Good for busy family homes and pet friendly spaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retractable window screens</h3>
  <p>
    Retractable screens suit lagoon facing and forest view windows where you want a minimalist look when screens are not needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Mesh selection for view, airflow and pets</h2>
  <p>
    The right mesh depends on how you use each opening:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard mesh for general insect control on windows.</li>
    <li>Pet resistant mesh where dogs or cats lean against doors.</li>
    <li>Darker mesh for better outward visibility during the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tip">
    Near wetlands and water, ask about cleaning routines to keep mesh clear of dust, pollen and mildew so airflow stays good.
  </div>

  <h2>Working with shutters, outdoor blinds and latches</h2>
  <p>
    Fly screens often sit in a small ecosystem of products:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Combine screens with <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutters</a>
      to control light and privacy while windows stay open.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use screens on doors behind <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor blinds</a>
      so you can open the doors during rain without bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety latch</a> for secure night ventilation where needed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who supplies fly screens in Sedgefield and the Garden Route</h2>
  <p>
    Home Coverings Guide does not fit screens. Sedgefield homeowners usually work with Garden Route companies that focus on
    insect and security screens and are comfortable with coastal conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    One example is <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/fly-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings™</a>,
    whose <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/fly-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fly screens page</a> explains door and window solutions.
    You can read more on the <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screens overview</a>,
    browse detailed articles on the <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insights blog</a>
    and request Sedgefield service through the
    <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact form</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Questions Sedgefield owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Will screens block my view of the lagoon or forest?</h3>
  <p>
    Light frames and darker mesh usually have little impact on daylight views.
    At night, you will notice them more when interior lights are on, but they remain lighter than security bars or gates.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I add screens to existing aluminium and timber frames?</h3>
  <p>
    In most cases yes. Screen suppliers can design hinged, sliding or retractable solutions around existing frames.
    Good photos and basic measurements are enough for an initial design suggestion.
  </p>

    Use this guide as a starting point when planning fly screens for your Sedgefield home or cottage.
    Confirm mesh grade, frame finishes and warranties with your chosen supplier.
