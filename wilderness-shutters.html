      <h1 class="hero-heading">Shutters in Wilderness: Light, Privacy and Coastal Durability</h1>
      <p class="hero-intro">
        Plantation shutters are popular in Wilderness homes that want privacy and security without heavy burglar bars.
        Used well, they control light, frame sea views and stand up to salt air better than many soft furnishings.
      </p>
      <section class="aeo-summary">
        <h2>Quick overview: what, who, where, cost and how</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What:</strong> Internal or security rated shutters in PVC or aluminium, installed in window and door openings.</li>
          <li><strong>Who:</strong> Good for Wilderness owners who value neat lines, easy cleaning and long term durability in a humid coastal climate.</li>
          <li><strong>Where:</strong> Often used in living rooms with sea views, main bedrooms, short term rental units and homes close to greenbelt areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost guide:</strong> Decorative PVC shutters usually start from ±R4 000 per square metre, with aluminium security shutters running higher depending on specification.</li>
          <li><strong>How:</strong> Decide if you need pure light control or security, then compare quotes that specify material, powder coating, locks and warranty.</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>PVC vs aluminium shutters for Wilderness conditions</h2>
      <p>
        The two common shutter materials behave differently along the Garden Route coast.
      </p>
      <h3>PVC interior shutters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Resist moisture far better than timber and are suitable for bathrooms and coastal bedrooms.</li>
        <li>Provide privacy and light control but are not a security barrier on their own.</li>
        <li>Work well in holiday homes where blinds might get damaged by frequent guests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Aluminium security shutters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Combine security with light control, replacing the need for separate burglar bars and curtains in many rooms.</li>
        <li>Marine grade aluminium and stainless hardware are important in Wilderness, where salt and wind are constant.</li>
        <li>Useful for upstairs doors leading to balconies and for stacker doors facing the dune systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        If you are close to the lagoon mouth or up on the hill with strong winds, request written confirmation that the shutter system has been used in similar coastal locations and ask to see local references.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rooms in Wilderness that benefit most from shutters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sea facing lounges:</strong> Adjustable louvres reduce glare on screens while keeping the view open.</li>
        <li><strong>Main bedrooms:</strong> Shutters can provide privacy from nearby neighbours without fully blocking early morning light.</li>
        <li><strong>Bathrooms:</strong> PVC shutters manage moisture better than many fabric window dressings.</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday rentals:</strong> Robust shutters cope better with frequent guests than delicate curtains.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design choices that affect comfort and price</h2>
      <p>
        Shutters are a long term decision, so it helps to understand the options that drive cost.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Panel layout:</strong> More panels give flexible operation but increase hardware and labour.</li>
        <li><strong>Louvre size:</strong> Wider louvres suit big Wilderness views and feel more contemporary.</li>
        <li><strong>Track systems:</strong> Top hung tracks can be easier to keep clean; bottom tracks collect sand and need more maintenance near the beach.</li>
        <li><strong>Colour:</strong> Coastal whites and soft greys are easier to touch up than deep colours that show scratches.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Care and cleaning of shutters in a coastal town</h2>
      <p>
        A gentle cleaning routine keeps shutters looking fresh in Wilderness humidity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dust louvres regularly with a microfibre cloth or soft brush attachment.</li>
        <li>Wipe frames and hinges with mild soapy water, then dry thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive pads which can damage powder coating.</li>
        <li>For security shutters, test locks and keys every few months to make sure they stay smooth.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions about shutters in Wilderness</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Do shutters help with noise from the N2 or nearby neighbours?</strong>
        <span>
          Shutters add a small amount of sound buffering but are not a full acoustic solution.
          They can soften echo in tiled rooms and take the edge off traffic noise when closed.
        </span>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Are shutters safe for homes with children and pets?</strong>
        <span>
          Shutters remove the need for cords, which improves child safety compared with some blind types.
          Pets generally adapt well and cannot tangle in cords that are not there.
        </span>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Should I put shutters on every window?</strong>
        <span>
          In many Wilderness homes shutters are used in key rooms such as living areas, main bedrooms and high exposure doors, then combined with other window coverings in secondary spaces.
        </span>
