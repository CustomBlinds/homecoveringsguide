<p>
Shutters are one of the most reliable long term window coverings for coastal homes in Knysna. 
This guide helps you understand the difference between **PVC indoor shutters** and **aluminium security shutters**, how they perform in Garden Route conditions, and what to consider before installation.
</p>

<h2>PVC Indoor Shutters for Knysna Homes</h2>
<p>
PVC shutters suit areas with high humidity, daily moisture changes and direct sunlight. They are designed for modern homes where owners want a clean look with good privacy, shade control and durability.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resistant to moisture, swelling and coastal air.</li>
  <li>Excellent for bathrooms, kitchens and full sun rooms.</li>
  <li>Light control plus clean, minimal style.</li>
  <li>Easy to wipe clean and maintain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security Shutters for Added Protection</h2>
<p>
Security shutters combine airflow, privacy and protection in one solution. These are suitable for sliding doors, patios and openings where homeowners want fresh air without compromising safety.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aluminium construction built for strength.</li>
  <li>Multi point locking for improved access control.</li>
  <li>Allows ventilation while securing the home.</li>
  <li>Excellent for coastal living where open windows are needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing the Right Shutters for Knysna</h2>
<p>When selecting shutters in Knysna, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> PVC performs best in bathrooms, kitchens and coastal humidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Use aluminium security shutters for patios, sliding doors and high traffic entries.</li>
  <li><strong>Louvre Width:</strong> Wider louvres give more modern aesthetics and better airflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Both options require minimal care compared to timber.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Tips for Knysna Homes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Measure accurately for frames inside or outside the reveal.</li>
  <li>Ensure walls around sliding doors are level for security shutter tracks.</li>

</ul>
