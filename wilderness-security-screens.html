  <h1>Security Screens in Wilderness</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Security screens give Wilderness homes a neat alternative to burglar bars.
    They help you keep sliding doors and windows open for fresh air while maintaining a physical barrier on vulnerable openings.
  </p>

    <h2>Quick answers for Wilderness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> High strength woven mesh screens in aluminium frames fitted to doors and windows.</li>
      <li><strong>Who</strong> Choose a supplier that uses tested products and understands coastal corrosion and hardware.</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> Sliding doors to decks, side paths, ground floor windows and apartment entrances.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost</strong> Depends on sizes, locking hardware, certification and whether you combine with shutters or gates.</li>
      <li><strong>How</strong> List every opening you want to protect, share photos and sizes, then compare screen and shutter options.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <h2>Why Wilderness owners look at security screens</h2>
  <p>
    Many Wilderness properties are used as permanent homes, part time residences or guest houses.
    Owners often want:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security that still feels light and coastal rather than heavy burglar bars.</li>
    <li>Airflow on hot nights when the breeze comes up the valley.</li>
    <li>Unobstructed views towards the sea, river or forest during the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How security screens differ from standard fly screens</h2>
  <p>
    A security screen combines heavy duty mesh, robust frames and proper locks.
    It can form part of your primary barrier on certain openings, whereas a basic insect screen is not built for force.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security mesh resists cutting and impact better than standard insect mesh.</li>
    <li>Frames are reinforced and anchored more securely into the building.</li>
    <li>Locks and hinges are chosen for strength, not only convenience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where security screens make sense in Wilderness</h2>
  <p>
    Common locations include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sliding doors from living rooms onto decks or patios.</li>
    <li>Side and back doors that open to paths, parking or service yards.</li>
    <li>Ground floor bedroom windows that you want to leave slightly open at night.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Combining security screens with shutters and outdoor blinds</h2>
  <p>
    Security screens are part of a layered system, not a complete plan on their own.
    You can combine them with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security shutters</a>
      on key openings where you want a more solid barrier and full light control.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outdoor blinds</a>
      on exposed decks so that comfort and weather are managed as well as security.
    </li>
    <li>
      Safety latches such as <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LockLatch</a>
      on smaller windows for controlled ventilation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who supplies security screens in Wilderness and the Garden Route</h2>
  <p>
    Home Coverings Guide is neutral and does not sell products. For Wilderness, most homeowners use Garden Route specialists
    that install both insect and security screens and can travel between towns.

    One example is the <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/screens/security-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security screen range from Custom Blinds Shutters &amp; Awnings™</a>,
    which forms part of a broader focus on shutters and blinds. You can explore product information on their

    and request site specific guidance through the

  <h2>Questions Wilderness owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Are security screens enough on their own for ground floor doors?</h3>
  <p>
    A properly specified security screen can form part of your primary barrier on many openings.
    In some cases you may still choose to combine screens with shutters, alarms or beams.
    Discuss your overall security plan with a specialist rather than focusing only on one product.
  </p>

  <h3>Will a security screen make my deck feel closed in?</h3>
  <p>
    Darker security mesh usually reads as light tint on the glass rather than a bar structure.
    During the day you keep view and airflow. At night you may notice the screen more once interior lights are on,
    but it remains visually lighter than a gate or bars.
