  <h1>Security Screens in Sedgefield</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Security screens give Sedgefield homes a neat way to combine airflow, view and a physical barrier
    on sliding doors and windows. They are especially useful for homes and cottages that are not occupied all year.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Sedgefield owners consider security screens</h2>
  <p>
    Sedgefield has a mix of permanent residents, semi retired owners and holiday visitors.
    Many owners want:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security that still looks light and coastal, not like heavy bars.</li>
    <li>Night ventilation with windows or doors partially open.</li>
    <li>Clear views toward the lagoon, dunes or forest during the day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How security screens differ from fly screens</h2>
  <p>
    Security screens use stronger mesh, reinforced frames and proper locking systems.
    They are part of a security plan, while standard fly screens are only for insects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security mesh resists cutting and impact better than normal insect mesh.</li>
    <li>Frames are designed for strength and fixed more securely.</li>
    <li>Locks and hinges are chosen to resist forced entry.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Good locations for security screens in Sedgefield</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Patio doors and sliders that open to verandas and braai spaces.</li>
    <li>Side entrances and scullery doors that are often left ajar.</li>
    <li>Ground floor bedroom windows that you would like to vent at night.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Combining security screens with shutters and latches</h2>
  <p>
    Security screens work best as part of a layered approach:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Screens plus <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/shutters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security shutters</a>
      on key areas for deeper security and light control.
    </li>
    <li>
      Screens plus <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/outdoor-blinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor blinds</a>
      on decks to manage weather while screens manage security.
    </li>
    <li>
      Screens plus <a href="https://customblinds.co.za/safetylatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety latches</a>
      on selected windows for controlled opening sizes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions Sedgefield owners often ask</h2>
  <h3>Are security screens enough on their own?</h3>
  <p>
    On many doors and some windows, a security screen can be a primary barrier.
    In higher risk situations you may still choose to combine screens with shutters, alarms or beams.
    It is better to think of screens as one part of a full security plan.
  </p>

  <h3>Will security screens make my home feel closed in?</h3>
  <p>
    Dark mesh tends to read like mild tint rather than a heavy structure.
    You keep airflow and day time views, especially on lagoon or garden facing openings,
    while gaining a sense of security at night or when you are away.
