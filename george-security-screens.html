    <h1>Security Screens in George – Fresh Air With Peace of Mind</h1>
    <p>
      George families often want doors and windows open for fresh air while still feeling secure. 
      Security screens give you airflow and visibility with a stronger barrier than standard fly screens.

      <h2>Quick answers about security screens</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What are security screens</strong> – high strength mesh set in structural aluminium frames, installed to resist forcing and cutting.</li>
        <li><strong>Where they work best</strong> – patio doors, front doors, side doors, and vulnerable windows at ground level.</li>
        <li><strong>How they differ from fly screens</strong> – security screens are thicker, stronger and lockable while still allowing air and light.</li>
        <li><strong>Ideal for George</strong> – homes with children, pets and regular braais where doors stay open for long periods.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why security screens make sense in George</h2>
      <p>
        Many homes in George depend on cross ventilation. Closing everything up to feel safe means rooms get hot and stuffy.
        Security screens allow you to keep doors and windows open while you cook, work or sleep.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enjoy night time airflow without leaving a door simply on a latch.</li>
        <li>Let children and pets move more freely between house and garden while you keep the main doors locked in place.</li>
        <li>Reduce stress in holiday homes that stand empty for part of the year.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security screens vs fly screens</h2>
      <p>
        Both products use mesh and frames, but they solve different problems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fly screens</strong> keep insects out and offer light airflow but are not designed to resist force.</li>
        <li><strong>Security screens</strong> combine insect protection with a strong barrier and lockable hardware.</li>
        <li>On busy doors, security screens are usually the better investment because they handle daily traffic and pushing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many homes use fly screens on quiet bedroom windows and security screens on sliding doors or main entrances.

      <h2>What to look for in a good security screen</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High grade stainless mesh that resists cutting and coastal corrosion.</li>
        <li>Rigid aluminium frames that fix into brick, concrete or structural steel, not only into plaster.</li>
        <li>Locks and hinges that are purpose made for security screens, not retrofitted from light doors.</li>
        <li>Professional measuring and installation with clear warranties.</li>
      </ul>
